# O2/co2 sensor Arduino
This is the code I used for an Astrobiology project at University of Kent, under Professor Nigel Mason.  
Its use is based on an Arduino Wifi Rev2, and was successfuly proved to work, though was not finally used in the project's main line of work.  
It is basically plug and play, if you are using the Arduino IDE.
